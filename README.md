# Subgradient step-size update rules in Lagrangian relaxations of chance-constrained optimization models
This project is based on the paper **Statistical performance of subgradient step-size update rules in Lagrangian relaxations of chance-constrained optimization models** by C. Ritter and B. Singh. 
There, using different computational experiments and statistical tests on two example instances of chance-constrained optimization problems, we investigate whether some step-size rules are particularly well suited for solving the Langrangian relaxation via the subgradient method for those kinds of models in practice.
We present the results of those tests and several additional investigations related to complementary bounding techniques.
We refer to the paper for further information on methods and conclusions.
A preprint of the manuscript that is currently under peer review is available at xxx.
## Repository content
The repository contains the following content:
- `code` contains all the GAMS code one needs to run the algorithms presented in the paper. One can direct through the subfolders to a specific instance of the desired model. There are starter files for the different algorithms included. `main_for_naive.gms` for the naive solution method, `main_for_lr1.gms` up to `main_for_lr6.gms` for the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm (Alg. 1) using step-size rule one to six, `SAA.gms` as part 1 of Algorithm 2 and `fixed_problem.gms` as part 2 of Algorithm 2. Analogously, `SAA_hi.gms` as part 1 of Algorithm 3 and `fixed_problem_hi.gms` as part 2 of Algorithm 3. In Model II we also have a starter file `MainHeuristic.gms` for the Algorithm 4. For Model I that is included and put out in the Lagrangian relaxation. 
- `results` contains the excel tables and figures visualizing the results that are partially also included in the paper. Thereby we differ between the `Example_Instances` and `Samples` for each model instance. The `Example_Instances` include the 16 instances we presented seperately in the paper for Model I and Model II, respectively. The `Samples` include all 20 batches of each scenario-size regime for Model I and Model II, respectively. 
## Requirements to run code
The code uses the optimization solver Gurobi, which is therefore required to run it.
