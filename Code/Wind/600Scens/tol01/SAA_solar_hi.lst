      This is Step 4 of Algorithm 1 of file v10.pdf (iEEE paper)
      Big M is updated
      Single file to run different values of rho
      Promise is updated at each iteration
      Can update with new wind scenarios file
       
      After this file, we run fixed scenario problem - dynamic_1500.gms
