      This is Step 4 of Algorithm 3 for solar model (Model I)
      Big M is updated
      Single file to run different values of rho
      Promise is updated at each iteration
      Can update with new wind scenarios file
       
      After this file, we run fixed scenario problem - fixed_problem_hi.gms
