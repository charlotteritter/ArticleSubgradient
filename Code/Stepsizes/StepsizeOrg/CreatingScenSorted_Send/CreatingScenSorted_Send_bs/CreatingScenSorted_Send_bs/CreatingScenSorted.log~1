Tried aggregator 1 time.
LP Presolve eliminated 160 rows and 121 columns.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.08 ticks)

--- Fixed MIP status (1): optimal.
--- Cplex Time: 0.00sec (det. 0.14 ticks)


Proven optimal solution
MIP Solution:       -12294.094001    (8 iterations, 0 nodes)
Final Solve:        -12294.094001    (0 iterations)

Best possible:      -12294.094001
Absolute gap:            0.000000
Relative gap:            0.000000
